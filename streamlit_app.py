    """Use the LLM to convert business requirements into technical requirements."""
    prompt_template = """You are a Senior Technical Procurement Specialist at a manufacturing firm. Your task is to convert the following Business Requirements Document (BRD) into a comprehensive, strictly technical requirements document. Use only the details provided in the BRD and do not add any external information. The output must include both functional and non-functional requirements for purchasing new servers, software, or other technical assets, and it should be written so that suppliers can unambiguously understand every specification.
                        Your output must clearly address each of the following key factors and include specific examples or ranges where applicable:
                        Requirement Clarity & Specification Accuracy
                        Example: If the BRD specifies intensive software handling, include a statement like "System must include 16 GB DDR4 RAM or more" to support heavy multitasking.
                        Example: For high computational performance, specify a processor such as "Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) or equivalent" or higher.
                        Standardized Descriptions
                        Example: Instead of vague terms like "fast processor," clearly state "Processor: Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) or better."
                        Example: For storage, specify "512GB SSD or higher" if the BRD indicates high storage needs.
                        Hidden Costs Consideration
                        Example: Include notes like "Include considerations for logistics, customs, and storage costs" when the BRD mentions any potential hidden costs.
                        Example: If delivery or installation is mentioned, ensure to note any additional expenses that might be incurred.
                        Regulatory Compliance
                        Example: If the BRD refers to adhering to industry standards, include "Ensure compliance with import/export laws and applicable industry standards."
                        Example: Specify required certifications or licenses if mentioned (e.g., "Operating System must be a licensed version of Windows 11 Pro").
                        Risk Mitigation
                        Example: If the BRD highlights potential risks, output "Include contract clauses for warranties (e.g., 3 years onsite warranty), penalties for delays, and risk mitigation measures."
                        Example: Mention hidden risks like "Consideration for potential downtime and its impact on operations."
                        Additionally, use the following example vendor bid to guide the level of detail expected. This example is for reference only and should not be copied verbatim unless the BRD contains matching details:
                        Processor: Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) or equivalent

                        Battery Life: 10 hours or more
                        Ports: e.g., 2× USB 3.0, 1× USB Type-C, HDMI, 3.5mm audio jack, Ethernet
                        Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0
                        Operating System: Windows 11 Pro (licensed)
                        Keyboard: Backlit keyboard
